The "commands" folder contains JSON data about all the commands
within Minecraft. Not all commands have been added yet, but you
can look at the existing command data and get a pretty good idea
of how the system works.

Commands with the same name will be merged if they are in different
namespaces, but if the command files are in the same namespace then
the later command file will override the earlier command file.
